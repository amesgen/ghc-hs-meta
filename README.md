# ghc-meta

GHC Parser -> Template Haskell Expression. For use in GHC 9.2.1 upgrade for [IHP](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp).

Shamelessly extracted from [`PyF`](https://github.com/guibou/PyF). Just trying to get something working for now -- hope to work with package author later!

The goal is to be able to use this package instead of `haskell-src-exts` and `haskell-src-meta` with minimal disruption.
